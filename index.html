            <p>Once there was a man whom the entire village knew to be a gossip.
                He could not wait to share the juiciest piece of gossip with
                whoever would listen. It did not matter to him if the stories he
                spread were true, or notâ€”he never stopped to ask.</p>
                p {
                    font-family: cursive;
                    font-size: 2em;
                    padding: 100;
                    margin: 100;
                    color: burlywood;
                    background-color: red;
                }
            <p>One day, after hearing the rabbi speak about the harm gossip
                causes, this man went to the rabbi and said, "Rabbi, I am truly
                sorry for all the pain I have caused with my loose lips. I
                repent and will gossip no more. Can I be forgiven?"</p>
                p {
                    font-family: cursive;
                    font-size: 2em;
                    padding: 100;
                    margin: 100;
                    color: burlywood;
                    background-color: red;
                }
            <p>"Yes," replied the rabbi, "but here is what you must do. Go home.
                Find a feather pillow. Open the pillow and release the feathers
                on the wind. Then, come back to me."</p>
                p {
                    font-family: cursive;
                    font-size: 2em;
                    padding: 100;
                    margin: 100;
                    color: burlywood;
                    background-color: red;
                }
            <p>The man thought this a strange request, but he did as he was
                told. When he came back, the rabbi said, "Now, go gather all the
                feathers released from the pillow."</p>
                p {
                    font-family: cursive;
                    font-size: 2em;

                    background-color: red;
                }
            <p>"But that is impossible! They have flown all over the place. I do
                not even know where most of them have traveled!"</p>
                p {
                    font-family: cursive;
                    font-size: 2em;
                    padding: 100;
                    margin: 100;

                    background-color: red;
                }
            <p>"So it is with words: you do know where your gossip and rumors
                have traveled. Once words have been uttered, they cannot be
                taken back."</p>
                p {
                    font-family: cursive;
                    font-size: 2em;
                    padding: 100;
                    margin: 100;
                    color: burlywood;
                    background-color: red;
                }
            <p>The man understood. From that day on, he was careful and
                thoughtful when speaking of others, and spoke with
                integrity.</p>
